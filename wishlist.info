- Referring to a property name in type localisation for types where localisation keys are explicit.
- starts_with filter for types/subtypes (for stuff like b_<title> or faction_<objective>).
- Autocomplete for matching nested types like options for game rules.

- A property, uh, property, that counts as a replacement for a parameter in a top-level type. For example, religion_group property ai_convert_other_group can be explicitly replaced by a religion. In such cases it should probably inform you what the default (religion_group value) currently is. Low priority as it's just religions.
